Born in Tibet Lord Jigten Sumgon (Rinchen Phel or Ratna Shri in Sanskrit) was an emanation of Buddha Shakyamuni and was considered to be one of the greatest disciples of Phagmo Drupa, who named him as his successor. Founded in 1994 by the Venerable Khenchen Konchog Gyaltshen Rinpoche, Chicago Ratna Shri Sangha has sustained itself with regular practice in the homes of local practitioners and teachings given by the precious lamas of the Drikung Kagyu lineage, who have been invited several times yearly.Under the guidance of our spiritual director, Drupon Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche, we are striving to establish a strong center dedicated to serving the Chicago area as a place for teachings, practice, contemplation, and meditation. Under the guidance of Drupon Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche, our goal is to sponsor regular retreats, teachings, and to maintain our regular weekly practice. In the future we hope to establish a broader spectrum of activities to benefit both the local community and other communities worldwide."

If you are new to Buddhist meditation, please plan to attend a meditation instruction session before your first visit. Our teacher, Myoshi Thomson, offers meditation instruction to newcomers every Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. in Suite 1008 of the same building. If you are planning on attending meditation instruction, please email us at info@zenchicago.org so we know to expect you.We practice in the S\u014dt\u014d Zen Buddhist tradition, which traces its heritage back to Buddha through a 2500-year history of fellow practitioners, including our ancient teachers Bodhidharma, Caoqi Huineng, Dongshan Liangjie, and Eihei D\u014dgen, and our modern teachers, Dainin Katagiri, Shoken Winecoff, and Myoshi Thomson, who guides our practice here in Chicago.We welcome all to join us in our practice of the way of Zen. What is this practice? The founder of our lineage in Japan, Eihei D\u014dgen (1200-1253), put it simply: \u201cTo study the Way is to study the self; to study the self is to forget the self; to forget the self is to be awakened by all things.\u201d Our practice, then, starts with ourselves, with seeing clearly who we are, and how we are, right now, in this moment.Our basic activity together is quiet seated meditation. Indeed, the word \u201cZen\u201d itself is derived from a Sanskrit word for meditation, and sitting in silent meditation has always been the central practice of awakening in Zen. But together we learn to practice the way of awakening in all our activities, and indeed to make our very lives themselves expressions of the awakened mind and heart."

    "Notes and Events": "The Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago is one of the oldest practicing Zen centers in the United States and the oldest continually-operating Chicago area Zen center. The Temple was founded in 1949 by Zengaku Soyu Matsuoka Roshi, whose family in Japan has a history of Zen priests dating back six hundred years. Daikaku Kongo Roshi (Richard Langlois), Matsuoka Roshi\u2019s disciple and dharma successor, became the Abbot and served in that post for 28 years. Kongo Roshi vigorously carried on the Zen traditions and teachings emphasizing the pure zazen (meditation) practice of shikantaza (just sitting) until his death in 1999. The Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago, inspired by our history, continues on in our tradition of promoting and supporting strong Zen practice."
